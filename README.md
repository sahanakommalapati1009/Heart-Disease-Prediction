# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided medical data and risk factors. It leverages a machine learning model trained using historical health data to assess the risk level efficiently. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface using Flask.
## Features:
* Input Fields: Users can enter medical data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant parameters.
* Prediction: The model predicts the probability of heart disease and provides a clear risk assessment.
* Visualization: Results and statistical data visualizations, such as risk distribution and feature importance, are included for better understanding.
* Web Application: Accessible via a Flask-based web app for easy interaction.
## Technologies Used:
* Machine Learning: Trained a classification model using scikit-learn.
* Data Analysis and Visualization: Used pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
* Web Framework: Flask for backend development and integration.
## Usage:
### 1. Install the dependencies:
* pip install -r requirements.txt
### 2. Run the application locally:
* python app.py
* Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to test the application.
